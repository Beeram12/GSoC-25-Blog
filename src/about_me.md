# About Me

I am currently a third-year Electrical Engineering student from Sardar Vallabhbhai National
Institute of Technology with a strong interest in systems programming, automation, and
DevOps. While my coursework primarily focuses on electronics and electrical systems, I
have actively explored low-level programming, operating systems, and automation tools,
which naturally led me to embedded systems.

My interest in embedded systems comes from working with microcontrollers for a project in
my college initially and understanding how software interacts with hardware at a deep level.
I enjoy optimizing performance, ensuring reliability, and automating workflowsâ€”critical
aspects of embedded development

I discovered RTEMS while exploring open-source projects from GSOC organizations and their
role in critical systems like aerospace, robotics, and industrial automation is huge. The
structured development process and community-driven approach of RTEMS motivated me to
work with the organization.

What makes me stand out is my ability to adapt and learn quickly. I have strong experience
in backend development with Go and C++, which helps me write efficient software.
Additionally, my interest in optimizing workflows allows me to improve development
processes.
